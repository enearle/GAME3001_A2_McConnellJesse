Thank you for using this Priority Queue package!

If you've got any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @AmyElliott_

I noticed a lack of priority queue implementation within Unity when creating a pathfinding system for a game (Dijkstra's Algorithm).
Priority Queues are part of .NET 6.0, and Unity uses .NET standard 2.0.

I've found an official .NET 6.0 repository on GitHub and found the code for Priority Queue, and I took that code and made it work within Unity!
So now there are priority queues in Unity!

.NET 6.0 Repository Priority Queue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Collections/src/System/Collections/Generic/PriorityQueue.cs
.NET 6.0 Runtime: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime

I haven't used Priority Queues much outside of my Dijkstra's Algorithm implementation, so I may have made mistakes with this Priority Queue port, and may have removed features which could have been needed! So please let me know if there are any issues and mistakes and I will address them!

This is 100% Free to Use and adapt on in Personal & Commercial Projects!
